#MIN TEMP TRENDS

##WW44SS
## Summary
This repository contains R-code which analyzes temperature data downloaded from the [National Climate Data Center](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/).  The website contains temerpature data for many locales extending back to the 1920's in may cases. 
  
The hypothesis this is intended to test is that the effects of climate change are most visible in the changes in __minimum__ temepratures, since the greenhouse traps heat and thus slows nightime cooling. 

Data downloads from the above website are not automated. The website serves data asynchonously so the program assumes the .csv file is stored locally. Typically files can be quite large, but an example file is stored in the repository. FIles may contain a variety of data. 


The columns important for this analysis are
TMAX and TMIN which are in tenths of a degree Celcius.
DATE Data is stored as YYYYMMDD
note than NA Values in the raw data are -9,999
